suggestions from interested parties on its [draft Request for Proposals

Wisconsin. DWD will use the comments and suggestions it receives in
response to this Request for Information (RFI) to finalize its RFP. This
RFI is issued solely for information and planning only and does not
constitute a solicitation. DWD will issue the finalized RFP in the near
